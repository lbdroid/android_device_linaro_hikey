Android Serial GPS Driver

Forked from https://github.com/kconger/android-serial-gps-driver.git

How to use:

To set serial port, add a property "ro.kernel.android.gps" and set it equal to your GPS device file.
ie. ro.kernel.android.gps=ttyO1

Default baud rate is 9600, to adjust add a property "ro.kernel.android.gpsttybaud" and set it equal to the needed rate. (4800-115200)
ie. ro.kernel.android.gpsttybaud=9600

To add power management for your target product, `cp power-stubs.c power-$(TARGET_PRODUCT).c` and fill in the stubs.

Notes:
* If using a USB device make sure you have the necessary kernel modules loaded or built in to the kernel.
* Make sure the permissions on your device file are correct
